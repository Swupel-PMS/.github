We are a small group of computer science enthusiasts working on a decentralized solution to the many problems with centralized land ownership. 
These problems are corruption, land grabbing, environmental damage and many more, which do not only result in extra costs for any government and landowner but also threaten the existence of indigenous populations, farmers or other not very wealthy and influential populations. 
Believing that the current global systems of land management are fundamentally flawed we strive to change the world for the better.
